1. Basic LSTM: A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that is capable of learning long-term dependencies, which makes it particularly useful for time series data. It has a chain-like structure with repeating modules of neural network layers. Each LSTM unit uses special gates to control the flow of information and prevent the vanishing gradient problem. It can be used for time series prediction, for instance in forecasting stock prices or weather.

2. Peephole LSTM: In a standard LSTM, the gate layers only have access to the previous hidden state and the current input. Peephole LSTMs, however, allow the gate layers to also 'peek' at the cell state. This can give the LSTM more precise control over when information is forgotten or passed along, which can be helpful in time series where timing is crucial, such as in speech recognition or musical beat detection.

3. Gated Recurrent Units (GRU): GRUs are a variant of LSTM with a simpler design, having only two gates (reset and update gates) and no cell state. GRUs combine the forget and input gates into a single "update gate." This simplicity often allows GRUs to perform on par with LSTM but with faster training and execution times. They could be used when LSTM might be overkill or too resource-intensive, like in smaller time series datasets.

4. Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM): BiLSTMs process data from past to future and from future to past, essentially seeing the sequence in both directions. This approach can provide additional context compared to regular LSTMs and can lead to better performance on certain tasks. It can be used in anomaly detection in time series data, as it's able to capture patterns that might be missed when looking only from past to future.

5. Convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM): ConvLSTMs replace the fully connected structure in the input-to-state and state-to-state transitions of LSTM with convolutional structures. This allows them to handle multidimensional data better, making them useful for spatiotemporal data such as video frame prediction and weather forecasting.

6. Attention LSTM: The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on certain parts of the sequence that are more relevant for a given task, rather than treating all parts of the sequence equally. This can be particularly useful in long sequences where certain time steps may be more informative. For time series prediction, an attention mechanism can help the model focus on specific influential past events to make a more accurate prediction.

7. Nested LSTM (N-LSTM): N-LSTMs are a recent development in LSTM architecture where LSTM cells are nested within each other. This design allows the model to operate at multiple timescales simultaneously, which can be beneficial in time series where patterns occur over different lengths of time, such as in music or speech generation.

8. Quantized LSTM (Q-LSTM): Q-LSTMs employ quantization techniques to reduce the computational resources required by LSTMs, making them more efficient. The precision of the weights, activations, and gradients are reduced during training, leading to models that require less memory and computation. This could be advantageous in embedded systems or other low-resource environments for real-time time series prediction.

9. Highway LSTM: Highway networks are a type of architecture that use gating mechanisms to adaptively decide how much of the output is produced by transforming the input and how much is just the untouched input. When combined with LSTMs, it can create models that can learn to shortcut through many timesteps, making them effective at modeling longer sequences. They can be used in tasks where long-term dependencies are prevalent, such as in financial time series where long-term trends and cycles are important.

10. Tree LSTM: Tree-structured LSTMs (Tree LSTMs) are a generalization of LSTMs to tree-structured network topologies. Unlike standard LSTMs, which have a chain-like structure, Tree LSTMs have a tree-like structure and allow for inputs from multiple predecessors. While they're often used in natural language processing to capture the hierarchical structure of sentences, they can also be used in time series data where there's a hierarchical or grouped structure. For example, in predicting the sales of a group of products where each product can be treated as a branch in the tree.
